What is it?
A vital web application for finding which streaming service offers the TV/sports program or film that you want to watch right NOW! Our app offers information on actors, run time, plot summary, ratings, ESPN game information/viewing schedules, links to games/video content, and displays some of our personal recommendations. 

How does it work?
Go to: https://reptile18.github.io/Purple-Pages/
Click on the golden links on the Navigation bar to search for your favorite show/event/film.  Click the generated results for a pop-up and/or a link to the actual video content.

Technologies/code:
The Web APIs Utelly and ESPN search availability of content from: Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Instant Video, Apple TV+, Google Play, iTunes, YouTube Premium, ESPN/sports channels, Disney Plus, Hulu, Atom Tickets, CBS, DC Universe, HBO, Discovery Channel, Fandango Movies, Fox, NBC, and Nickelodeon.

The Web API OMDB delivers background and ratings information for TV/film along with classic movie posters and more!

We used the Foundation CSS framework to create cool pop-ups, a working carousel, and a clean, cohesive grid UI.

We used jQuery/JavaScript to animate elements and dynamically update our HTML/CSS. 

Process:
This was our first group project in Github utilizing many branches, pull/merge requests and conflicts, collaborative troubleshooting, stand-up meetings, the kanban board, and solving issues together to render an impressive final product.
